‚öôÔ∏è GaiaChain Compute Layer
üéØ Purpose
GaiaChain‚Äôs compute layer balances trustless on-chain logic with high-performance off-chain AI computations. This hybrid model ensures verifiability, scalability, and strong privacy guarantees‚Äîcore requirements for decentralized intelligent agents (dAIs) operating at scale.

üß© On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Compute
Aspect	On-Chain	Off-Chain
Location	Smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains	Decentralized compute nodes (edge/cloud)
Used For	Governance logic, payments, registry	ML inference, federated training, storage
Performance	Deterministic but limited	High-throughput, hardware-accelerated
Security Model	Transparent, trustless	Verified via cryptographic proofs (zk/TEE)
On-Chain
Implements DAO governance, staking, agent lifecycle tracking, and payments.

Lightweight agents may expose on-chain inference endpoints for simple tasks.

Off-Chain
Heavy AI workloads are processed via a decentralized compute mesh.

Each compute node stakes GAIA and follows strict SLAs for task execution.

üîê Verifiable Compute Techniques
To maintain trust in off-chain computation, GaiaChain employs multiple privacy-preserving, verifiability-focused technologies:

1. zkML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning)
Proves that an inference result was derived from a known model and input.

Ensures correctness without revealing private data or model weights.

Uses tools like RISC Zero, zkSync, or custom SNARKs/STARKs.

2. MPC (Multi-Party Computation)
Multiple nodes jointly compute on encrypted data.

No single party sees the full input or model.

Used for collaborative training and federated analytics.

3. TEE (Trusted Execution Environments)
Hardware-based secure enclaves (e.g., Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone).

Off-chain nodes execute agents inside TEEs with cryptographic attestation.

Preferred for real-time or high-load inferences that can‚Äôt be efficiently proven via ZK.

üèó Compute Infrastructure
GaiaChain supports a decentralized network of compute participants, categorized by role:

Node Type	Description
Inference Nodes	Run dAI models and return responses with verification.
Training Nodes	Participate in federated learning and agent updates.
Relay Nodes	Distribute inference requests, orchestrate swarms.
TEE Hosts	Provide hardware-secured computation environments.
Participation Requirements
Stake GAIA tokens to register as a verified compute provider.

Agree to SLAs, uptime, and latency targets.

Submit regular performance and integrity proofs.

üì¶ Computational Requirements by Use Case
Use Case	Compute Profile
Chat/LLM Agent	High memory, GPU-accelerated inference (off-chain)
Prediction Markets	Light CPU usage + zkML for verifiability
Edge Vision Agent	Federated TEE execution + optional ZK compression
Legal/Compliance Agent	MPC collaboration between jurisdictions
Art/Generative Agent	Requires GPU rendering + optional streaming via IPFS
‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancing and Redundancy
GaiaChain supports redundant compute assignment to avoid single-point inference failures.

Compute task sharding across swarms optimizes parallel processing.

DAO adjusts resource allocations via economic incentives and real-time telemetry.

üîÆ Future Enhancements
Composable Compute Pipelines: Chaining multiple agents across different nodes with persistent state.

Adaptive Trust Models: Dynamic switch between ZK, TEE, or MPC based on task sensitivity and cost.

Edge Scaling Toolkit: Auto-onboarding of mobile/IoT devices as micro-inference nodes.
