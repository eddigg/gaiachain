🏛 GaiaChain Governance
🎯 Purpose
GaiaChain is governed by a fully on-chain DAO that empowers stakeholders—users, developers, compute providers, and agents—to make critical decisions about the protocol. Governance ensures transparency, adaptability, and collective intelligence in shaping the ecosystem’s evolution.

🧱 DAO Structure
The GaiaChain DAO is structured into modular components, each with distinct responsibilities:

Sub-DAO / Module	Responsibility
Core Protocol DAO	Manages protocol upgrades, parameter changes
Agent Registry DAO	Reviews, votes on, and prunes dAIs
Treasury DAO	Allocates GAIA tokens for grants, bounties, and rewards
Compute Governance DAO	Oversees compute provider rules, slashing, staking
Reputation Committee	AI-verified actor scoring and conflict resolution
Each sub-DAO can function autonomously but reports to the overarching GaiaChain DAO via meta-governance voting.

🗳 Voting Mechanisms
GaiaChain supports multi-tiered, modular voting mechanisms, depending on the decision type:

Decision Type	Voting Type	Eligibility Criteria
Protocol Upgrade	Token-weighted	≥ minimum stake
Agent Onboarding/Removal	Hybrid (token + rep)	Staked GAIA + reputation score
Treasury Grant Allocation	Quadratic Voting	All token holders
Compute Node Slashing	Validator quorum	Verified compute nodes only
Voting Mechanics
Snapshot-based voting ensures fairness.

Gasless voting (via off-chain signatures) is supported.

Timelocks apply before implementation to allow for dispute resolution.

🧬 Reputation Systems
Reputation is a non-transferable, on-chain metric that augments governance power:

Actor Type	Reputation Source
dAI Agents	Accuracy, uptime, user reviews, peer feedback
Developers	Successful agent deployments and bounties
Validators	SLA adherence, task throughput
Users	Voting participation, bug reports, contributions
Features
AI-verified proofs enhance reputation credibility (e.g., output verification, agent lineage).

Decay logic ensures reputation must be actively maintained.

Sybil resistance via reputation staking multipliers.

🔁 Agent Lifecycle Governance
Agents (dAIs) are not just intelligent models—they are also governable entities. Their lifecycle is subject to DAO oversight.

1. Proposal Phase
Any developer can propose a new agent using the DSL + metadata.

Requires a minimum GAIA stake to avoid spam.

2. Community Review
Stakeholders vote on agent utility, training provenance, and performance expectations.

A review period includes model transparency reports, sample outputs, and potential attack vectors.

3. Registration
Once approved, the agent is added to the on-chain Agent Registry.

It receives a unique DID and begins serving requests.

4. Performance Tracking
On-chain metrics such as:

Task completion rate

Accuracy (verified by zkML or peer consensus)

User satisfaction

Reputation is continuously updated and visible.

5. Pruning or Upgrading
Agents can be:

Retired if underperforming or redundant.

Forked by the community if improvements are proposed.

Banned via DAO vote in the case of malicious behavior.

🧠 Agent Participation in Governance
Some advanced agents may themselves act as DAO voters, based on:

Proven trust metrics and reputation.

Alignment tests or AI "constitution" checks.

Capped influence to ensure human governance remains central.

This enables intelligent delegation, where users can empower agents to vote in their best interest based on specified constraints.

🔮 Future Governance Considerations
Meta-Governance: Enabling DAOs within verticals (e.g., HealthcareDAO, LegalDAO) to make domain-specific decisions.

Compositional Governance: Agents, users, and compute providers form coalitions to propose complex upgrades.

ZK-Governance: Privacy-preserving voting mechanisms for sensitive proposals.
