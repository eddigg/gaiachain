# GaiaChain Architecture

## 🧠 Purpose

This document provides a high-level, yet comprehensive overview of the **GaiaChain architecture**. It is designed to help developers, researchers, and system architects understand how GaiaChain operates as a unified platform for decentralized AI and economic coordination.

Understanding the architecture is a prerequisite for diving into specific components, such as the DSL, agent runtime, compute layer, and token mechanics.

## 🧩 Major Components

GaiaChain integrates five core components:

### 1. **Decentralized AI Agents (dAIs)**
- Specialized, domain-specific agents (e.g., for legal, finance, creative work).
- Capable of operating independently or in multi-agent "swarms".
- Communicate via **smart contracts** and an **intent DSL**.
- Continuously improved through **federated learning**, **on-chain feedback**, and **self-healing logic**.

### 2. **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**
- A high-level, declarative language for expressing agent intent, behaviors, and contracts.
- Enables agents to declare goals, constraints, and expected interactions.
- Acts as the **interoperability layer** across agents, blockchains, and services.

### 3. **Compute Layer**
- Hybrid off-chain/on-chain design:
  - Blockchain smart contracts manage state, logic, and governance.
  - Off-chain compute (via decentralized nodes) handles heavy AI inference.
- Incorporates **zkML**, **MPC**, and **TEEs** for secure, privacy-preserving operations.
- Edge devices contribute compute power and earn GAIA tokens.

### 4. **Tokenomics (GAIA Token)**
- Fuels the ecosystem through:
  - Payments for services.
  - Staking and governance participation.
  - Developer bounties and rewards for data/computation providers.
- Tightly integrated with reputation and feedback metrics to align incentives.

### 5. **DAO Governance**
- Fully on-chain community governance via voting.
- Agent onboarding/removal, resource allocation, and protocol upgrades are DAO-controlled.
- Influence weighted by **AI-verified contributions** and staking.

- The **DSL** mediates interaction between users, agents, and infrastructure.
- Agents query or call other agents, trigger contracts, or offload compute jobs.
- Agents evolve through feedback loops: usage metrics, performance data, and DAO voting.

## 🧬 High-Level Design Considerations

- **Modularity**: Each subsystem (DSL, compute, governance, tokenomics) is decoupled but interoperable.
- **Scalability**: Off-chain compute enables high throughput and inference scalability.
- **Security & Privacy**: Uses advanced cryptography (zkML, MPC) and decentralized governance to maintain trust.
- **Verifiability**: All agent actions and economic transactions are auditable and linked to a transparent logic chain.
- **Human-AI Alignment**: Reputation systems and governance ensure ethical, useful agent behavior.
