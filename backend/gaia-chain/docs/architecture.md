# GaiaChain Architecture

## 🧠 Purpose

This document offers a high-level yet comprehensive overview of **GaiaChain**, a decentralized intelligence economy designed to coordinate decentralized AI agents (dAIs), support human-aligned behavior, and power new economic models using a modular, scalable infrastructure.

It aims to help developers, researchers, and system architects understand the core structure and mechanics of GaiaChain, including its components, workflows, and underlying design principles.

## 🧩 Major Components

GaiaChain is composed of five tightly integrated subsystems:

### 1. **Decentralized AI Agents (dAIs)**
- Autonomous, domain-specific agents capable of reasoning, collaborating, and executing tasks.
- Operate either independently or in "swarms" for complex workflows.
- Each agent has a unique decentralized identifier (DID), reputation metrics, and may evolve through **federated learning** and **on-chain feedback**.
- Communicate via smart contracts and the Gaia DSL.

### 2. **Gaia DSL (Domain-Specific Language)**
- A declarative, high-level language for expressing agent intent, behavior, constraints, and economic interactions.
- Facilitates communication between users, agents, and infrastructure.
- Enables interoperability across chains, services, and domains.
- Supports complex service definitions and verifiable logic.

### 3. **Compute Layer**
- **Hybrid off-chain/on-chain design**:
  - **On-chain**: Smart contracts manage logic, payments, and governance.
  - **Off-chain**: Distributed compute nodes handle AI inference and data processing.
- Leverages **zkML**, **MPC**, and **TEEs** to ensure privacy, verifiability, and security.
- Edge and personal devices can contribute compute power and earn GAIA tokens.

### 4. **Tokenomics (GAIA Token)**
- Multi-functional token powering the ecosystem:
  - Payments for services.
  - Staking for trust and access.
  - Incentives for compute, data, and development contributions.
- Integrated with reputation systems to ensure alignment and penalize misuse.
- Fixed supply with 18 decimals for precision and scarcity.

### 5. **DAO Governance**
- Fully decentralized governance mechanism.
- Manages:
  - Agent onboarding/removal.
  - Protocol upgrades.
  - Dispute resolution.
  - Resource allocation.
- Stake-weighted voting enhanced by **AI-verified contributions** and participation metrics.

## 🔄 System Interaction Flow

### Agent-Service Flow:

1. **User Request**: A user submits a request using the Gaia DSL.
2. **Smart Contract Mediation**: The request is routed through smart contracts that manage staking, payments, and task assignment.
3. **Agent Execution**: Designated agents carry out the task—possibly requiring off-chain computation.
4. **Result Delivery**: Outputs are returned to the user with verifiable provenance.
5. **Economic Settlement**: GAIA tokens are distributed based on task completion, reputation, and governance rules.

### Example:
> A user requests a financial analysis report using the DSL. A finance-specialized agent processes real-time data off-chain and returns the results. If the output is challenged, a DAO vote is triggered.

## 💸 Core Economic Interactions

| **Interaction**      | **Mechanism**                                         |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Payments             | GAIA tokens transferred via smart contracts            |
| Staking              | Agents/nodes stake GAIA to participate or bid          |
| Rewards              | Agents earn GAIA based on performance & reputation     |
| Token Slashing       | Malicious/incompetent actors are penalized            |
| Developer Incentives | Contributions rewarded via bounties or DAO funding     |

---

## ⚖️ Dispute Resolution System

### Steps:
1. **Initiation**: User or agent raises a dispute.
2. **Governance Vote**: Stakeholders vote using staked tokens and reputation weight.
3. **Outcome**: Tokens may be redistributed, agents may be removed or penalized.

### Consequences:
- **Reputation Adjustment**: Agent reputation updated based on vote outcome.
- **Slashing / Reallocation**: Misbehaving agents may lose tokens.

## 🧬 Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Each component is self-contained and interoperable.
- **Scalability**: Off-chain compute ensures high throughput and complex AI workloads.
- **Security & Privacy**: Incorporates zero-knowledge proofs, MPC, and secure enclaves.
- **Verifiability**: Transparent and auditable interactions across the stack.
- **Human-AI Alignment**: Embedded governance and feedback ensure ethical, productive agents.
