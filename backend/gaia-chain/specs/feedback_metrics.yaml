# Feedback Metrics for GaiaChain

# Rationale: This is a key element to be included in the project. How will the system measure its performance and obtain feedback.

feedback_metrics:
  - name: ResponseTime
    description: Measure the average response time of the decentralized AI agents.
    type: time
    unit: milliseconds
    method: |
      Track the time taken from receiving a request to providing a response.
    target: 100ms

  - name: Accuracy
    description: Measure the accuracy of AI agent responses.
    type: percentage
    unit: percent
    method: |
      Compare the AI agent's responses with a set of predefined correct answers.
    target: 95%

  - name: Uptime
    description: Measure the system uptime.
    type: time
    unit: percentage
    method: |
      Track the total time the system is operational versus the total possible uptime.
    target: 99.9%

  - name: UserSatisfaction
    description: Measure user satisfaction through feedback surveys.
    type: score
    unit: rating
    method: |
      Conduct surveys to gather user satisfaction ratings on a scale of 1 to 5.
