GaiaChain Architecture Diagram
🎯 Purpose
This diagram complements the textual overview in docs/architecture.md by providing a visual representation of GaiaChain’s high-level architecture.

It outlines how decentralized AI agents, smart contracts, the domain-specific language (DSL), off-chain compute, tokenomics, and DAO governance interact within the ecosystem.

🧩 Explanation of Components
👤 User / Client
The initiator of interaction. Expresses goals and intents via the DSL.

📝 Intent Expression (DSL)
GaiaChain’s declarative language for defining goals, agent behavior, constraints, and incentives.

📜 Smart Contract Interface
Mediates between users, agents, governance, and compute. Ensures verifiable, trustless coordination.

🤖 Decentralized AI Agents (dAIs)
Domain-specialized agents capable of autonomous reasoning, collaboration, and evolution.

🧠 Off-Chain Compute Layer
Executes heavy AI inference using secure decentralized nodes (zkML, TEEs, MPC).

📤 Result / Feedback
Users receive AI-generated results; these outputs feed performance tracking mechanisms.

📊 On-chain Feedback Loop
Tracks usage, accuracy, and reputation to adaptively reward or prune agents.

🏛️ DAO Governance
A fully on-chain system for protocol upgrades, agent lifecycle decisions, and resource allocation.

💰 GAIA Token Flow
Incentivizes participation through payments, staking, rewards, and bounties.
