GaiaChain
🌍 Overview
GaiaChain is a next-generation platform designed to power the Autonomous Intelligence Economy (AIE)—a system where intelligent agents, humans, and organizations can co-create, govern, and exchange value.

At its core, GaiaChain aims to enable economic coordination among autonomous agents (AAs), leveraging decentralized AI, cryptoeconomic protocols, and a domain-specific language (DSL) for expressing intents and coordinating actions.

💡 Rationale
This project seeks to establish a programmable economy where autonomous agents act with agency, forming dynamic coalitions, transacting value, and optimizing outcomes based on shared goals and individual preferences.

To achieve this, GaiaChain integrates:
- An Intent-centric DSL for defining what agents want to achieve and how.
- A multi-agent orchestration framework allowing collaboration, negotiation, and resource allocation.
- Composable economic primitives, such as DAOs, smart contracts, and incentive mechanisms.
- Verifiable AI agents that operate within ethical and economic constraints.

This repository is the main entry point for developers, researchers, and contributors to understand, extend, and deploy components of GaiaChain.

🧠 What is the DSL?
The Gaia DSL (Domain-Specific Language) is a high-level, declarative language for expressing:
- Agent goals and behaviors.
- Protocols for cooperation and negotiation.
- Economic interactions (e.g., service provisioning, token exchanges).
- Constraints on computation, cost, and alignment.

It acts as the glue between intelligent agents, blockchain systems, and decentralized services.
