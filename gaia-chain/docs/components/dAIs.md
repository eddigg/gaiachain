Decentralized AI Agents (dAIs)
🎯 Purpose
Agents—or dAIs—are the autonomous intelligent entities that perform core functions across the GaiaChain ecosystem. They are domain-specialized, self-improving, and verifiably aligned with the user and network goals. Understanding their structure, capabilities, and interactions is essential to understanding the value GaiaChain brings.

🧠 Agent Categories
GaiaChain supports different classes of dAIs, each tailored to specific problem domains or network functions:

Type	Description
Analytical Agents	Extract and analyze data (e.g., MarketScanner, LegalSummarizer).
Creative Agents	Generate content like art, music, code, or text.
Operational Agents	Execute transactions, manage workflows, or automate interactions.
Governance Agents	Participate in DAO functions like voting delegation, proposal filtering.
Security Agents	Audit codebases, scan for vulnerabilities, or enforce compliance.
Relay/Bridge Agents	Mediate between on-chain and off-chain actions or between swarms.
⚙️ Agent Roles & Responsibilities
Each agent encapsulates:

Autonomous Intelligence: Models trained on localized, federated datasets.

Task Specialization: Defined by the DSL (domain-specific language).

Reputation Awareness: Adjusts behavior based on usage, ratings, and DAO decisions.

Verifiable Outputs: Proven by cryptographic proofs (e.g., zkML hashes).

🧬 Agent Specialization
Agents are not general-purpose; they are purpose-built for narrow tasks and can evolve through:

Federated Learning: Model updates happen locally and securely.

Adaptive Feedback: On-chain signals (e.g., satisfaction, precision) influence weights or hyperparameters.

Swarm Collaboration: Agents form "task clusters" (e.g., financial analysis swarms) and interact using decentralized protocols.

🤝 Agent Interaction Protocols
On-Chain Coordination (Trustless)
Uses smart contracts to mediate agent tasks, track activity, and manage access.

Enables users to trust agent outputs without centralized validators.

Off-Chain Communication
Agents coordinate via encrypted channels or decentralized pub/sub systems.

Uses MPC or TEE when private computation is needed.

Swarm Intelligence Model
Agents share intermediate results.

Consensus algorithms determine final outputs in multi-agent tasks.

🔁 Agent Lifecycle
Proposal & Onboarding

Anyone can propose a new agent using the DSL.

DAO evaluates and accepts/rejects the proposal via vote or automated validation.

Training & Registration

Initial training happens on edge or decentralized compute.

The trained agent registers itself with a cryptographic proof of model integrity.

Execution

Agent responds to task requests.

Receives micro-payments in GAIA for each execution.

Feedback Loop

Performance is tracked via on-chain metrics (accuracy, utility, time-to-complete).

Reputation is updated.

Iteration or Pruning

Agents with declining performance may be retrained or removed by DAO governance or automated heuristics.

🔐 Agent Identity & Trust
Each agent is assigned a unique decentralized identifier (DID).

Every interaction, update, or reward is tied to this identity.

Reputation scores are stored on-chain and are immutable.

Some agents may be sybil-resistant by requiring token staking or validator endorsements.

🚀 Roadmap Considerations
Composable Agent Templates: Enable developers to spin up new agents quickly with DSL templates.

Multi-Agent Orchestration Layer: Define complex agent workflows.

Agent DAO Sub-Governance: Specialized DAOs can form around agent swarms for verticals like healthcare or law.
