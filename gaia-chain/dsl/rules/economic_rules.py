"""
Economic Rules for Gaia DSL

This module defines the core economic concepts and types used in the Gaia DSL. The DSL is a high-level, declarative
language for the GaiaChain ecosystem, enabling users to define decentralized AI agents (dAls), request services, and
express economic interactions.

The Gaia DSL is central to GaiaChain, a decentralized intelligence economy powered by the GAIA token and governed by a DAO.
This module provides the economic foundation for the DSLâ€™s syntax, forming the backbone for service requests, payments,
and dispute resolution.

Key Components:
1. Payments
2. Service Agreements
3. Disputes
